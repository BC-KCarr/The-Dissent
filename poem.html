								<h3>Are You Available</h3>
								<p>Part of the mass, now singled to your own piece<br />
									Stood with the group, but now you’re on your own feet<br />
									There was a time when no one seemed to leave you<br />
									No it seems, no one tends to see you<br />
									No longer identified with the world’s people<br />
									If they mistreat you, they did not commit a crime<br />
									Or violate your rights, because you’re not seen as equal<br />
									And you’re not, because of what’s in the inside<br />
									It’s like a star, because it heats as it shines<br />
									But it doesn’t need a stage to bring attention to it’s light<br />
									You won’t blaze for the moment, and burnout by the morning<br />
									But wax for the torn, and shed for the mourning<br />
									This isn’t ordinary, to most intimidating<br />
									That you of no value exceeded expectations<br />
									If they won’t detain you, self will restrain you<br />
									But none can stop the truth, if you’re available</p>

								<p>All have the pine in their eyes to be great<br />
									But can you lionize the lives soaked in strife<br />
									To toss a lifeline in the seas made of their crying<br />
									Be a spark to the flame of the soul for their drying<br />
									Most of us just aspire<br />
									As long as we keep eating, other’s lives can expire<br />
									But I feel we come to a choice in our lives<br />
									To be glutenous in self, or stop eating the plate of lies<br />
									Fasting from self, to try and fasten yourself<br />
									To a diet that is fashioned for health<br />
									Cease from living through appetites, to ample life<br />
									Beyond the desires to postpone death/<br />
									Claiming you’re living to the fullest, sounds foolish<br />
									When nothing trickles down during your constant moving<br />
									Leaving the vessels under you half empty and destitute<br />
									To the brim you weren’t filled, cause space wasn’t available</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>More to Life</h4>
								<p>There’s more to life than what we see right before us.<br/>
									Getting caught in “could’s” and “would’s”, it’ll get as thick as a forest.<br/>
									There’s more to life than the ability to touch.<br/>
									Because once that thing is gone, you won’t feel much.<br/>
									There’s more to life than things that are satisfying.<br/>
									As long as you have eyes, you won’t fill the voids in your iris.<br/>
									There’s more to life than bodies that attract.<br/>
									If it doesn’t know love, then it won’t love back.<br/>
									Which means there’s more to life than knowing one another.<br/>
									If I don’t know me, how could I know another.<br/>
									But there’s more to life than the existence of your views.<br/>
									Wisdom is not gained from disclosing your own truth.<br/>
									And, there’s more to life than the life of your struggles.<br/>
									All have strife, and none is worse than another’s.<br/>
									Not to blind you, just trying to shed light<br/>
									On the truth, that there’s more to life.</p>

								<p>There’s more to life than all the worlds cash.<br/>
									It can’t buy love, peace, and grace that’ll last.<br/>
									There’s more to life than women that are fast.<br/>
									Because at the right speed, you’re sure to lose track.<br/>
									There’s more to life than having a lot of stones.<br/>
									Possibly all the ice may make one emotionless.<br/>
									So, there’s more to life than being the coolest.<br/>
									Because the hottest trends are growing cold.<br/>
									There’s more to life than trying to please people.<br/>
									If you favor one, the others feel unequal.<br/>
									So, there’s more to life than what they say.<br/>
									Keep your eyes focused and follow what’s been paved.<br/>
									There’s more to life than the world’s deafness.<br/>
									You know you heard a word, they don’t want you to listen.<br/>
									They may frown because you shine too bright,<br/>
									But show them that there’s more to life.<br/>
									- Isaiah White</p>
