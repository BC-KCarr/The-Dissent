								<h3>Are You Available</h3>
								<p>Part of the mass, now singled to your own piece<br />
									Stood with the group, but now you’re on your own feet<br />
									There was a time when no one seemed to leave you<br />
									No it seems, no one tends to see you<br />
									No longer identified with the world’s people<br />
									If they mistreat you, they did not commit a crime<br />
									Or violate your rights, because you’re not seen as equal<br />
									And you’re not, because of what’s in the inside<br />
									It’s like a star, because it heats as it shines<br />
									But it doesn’t need a stage to bring attention to it’s light<br />
									You won’t blaze for the moment, and burnout by the morning<br />
									But wax for the torn, and shed for the mourning<br />
									This isn’t ordinary, to most intimidating<br />
									That you of no value exceeded expectations<br />
									If they won’t detain you, self will restrain you<br />
									But none can stop the truth, if you’re available</p>

								<p>All have the pine in their eyes to be great<br />
									But can you lionize the lives soaked in strife<br />
									To toss a lifeline in the seas made of their crying<br />
									Be a spark to the flame of the soul for their drying<br />
									Most of us just aspire<br />
									As long as we keep eating, other’s lives can expire<br />
									But I feel we come to a choice in our lives<br />
									To be glutenous in self, or stop eating the plate of lies<br />
									Fasting from self, to try and fasten yourself<br />
									To a diet that is fashioned for health<br />
									Cease from living through appetites, to ample life<br />
									Beyond the desires to postpone death/<br />
									Claiming you’re living to the fullest, sounds foolish<br />
									When nothing trickles down during your constant moving<br />
									Leaving the vessels under you half empty and destitute<br />
									To the brim you weren’t filled, cause space wasn’t available<br/></p>

								<hr />

								<h4>More to Life</h4>
								<p>There’s more to life than what we see right before us.<br/>
									Getting caught in “could’s” and “would’s”, it’ll get as thick as a forest.<br/>
									There’s more to life than the ability to touch.<br/>
									Because once that thing is gone, you won’t feel much.<br/>
									There’s more to life than things that are satisfying.<br/>
									As long as you have eyes, you won’t fill the voids in your iris.<br/>
									There’s more to life than bodies that attract.<br/>
									If it doesn’t know love, then it won’t love back.<br/>
									Which means there’s more to life than knowing one another.<br/>
									If I don’t know me, how could I know another.<br/>
									But there’s more to life than the existence of your views.<br/>
									Wisdom is not gained from disclosing your own truth.<br/>
									And, there’s more to life than the life of your struggles.<br/>
									All have strife, and none is worse than another’s.<br/>
									Not to blind you, just trying to shed light<br/>
									On the truth, that there’s more to life.</p>

								<p>There’s more to life than all the worlds cash.<br/>
									It can’t buy love, peace, and grace that’ll last.<br/>
									There’s more to life than women that are fast.<br/>
									Because at the right speed, you’re sure to lose track.<br/>
									There’s more to life than having a lot of stones.<br/>
									Possibly all the ice may make one emotionless.<br/>
									So, there’s more to life than being the coolest.<br/>
									Because the hottest trends are growing cold.<br/>
									There’s more to life than trying to please people.<br/>
									If you favor one, the others feel unequal.<br/>
									So, there’s more to life than what they say.<br/>
									Keep your eyes focused and follow what’s been paved.<br/>
									There’s more to life than the world’s deafness.<br/>
									You know you heard a word, they don’t want you to listen.<br/>
									They may frown because you shine too bright,<br/>
									But show them that there’s more to life.<br/></p>

									<h4>Loiterer</h4>
									<p>I&#39;ve been around here for a minute.<br/>
										You thought I left, but I&#39;m still up in this.<br/>
										Real adversaries will always tarry<br/>
										For your demise, if they are living.<br/>
										I have some work that I haven&#39;t finished.<br/>
										I am the hurt of you daily grimace.<br/>
										You&#39;ve been distracted, I&#39;ve been relaxing<br/>
										Because you believe there&#39;s bigger business.<br/>
										Because you perceive there&#39;s better interest.<br/>
										And you grieve in their disappearance.<br/>
										But, their importance is a distortion<br/>
										Of your life and the way you live it.<br/>
										Maybe you can see me very vivid.<br/>
										But, you are scared of my existence.<br/>
										So, you cover up with the other stuff<br/>
										To take your mind off your condition.<br/>
										Trying to act like we&#39;re not conflicting,<br/> 
										And I&#39;m not really fucking with your feelings.<br/>
										But to get rid of THIS, you must be intimate<br/>
										With yourself and with the enemy.<br/>
										Or, you too will become a villain.<br/> 
										Viewing the world with a very cynic<br/>
										Type of mindset, thinking you found it<br/>
										Because you express your hurt in excess.<br/>
										Believing a cold heart gave you access<br/>
										To all the facts of Life&#39;s secrets.<br/> 
										But, that&#39;s not possible without control.<br/>
										See, your revelations are from my genesis.<br/>
										Every step you took, I was the cause of it.<br/>
										Everything you made, I was the elements.<br/>
										I devoured all of the power<br/>
										The very hour that you neglected me.<br/>
										So, sweep me under the rug.<br/>
										The dirt will soon pile up.<br/>
										I know how big your closet is.<br/>
										There&#39;s not enough room for the skeletons.<br/>
										Because you share things in marriages,<br/>
										And bondage is what this marriage is.<br/>
										Don&#39;t you think that I&#39;ll just pack and leave.<br/>
										I&#39;ll wear this ring until you get rid of me.<br/>
										... So face me.<br/>
										</p>

										<hr/>

										<h4>The Jewel</h4>
										<p>It’s the only thing I have to give.<br/>
											It’s the only reason I rise to live.<br/>
											It’s the greater part of my identity.<br/>
											It’s because of this you notice me.<br/>
											I was confused of its existence.<br/>
											Thought it was something that needed seeking.<br/>
											Thought it would be earned with my labor,<br/>
											But it’s my work to share it with my neighbor.<br/>
											Daily, it was perfected.<br/> 
											For the moments to share it, in discretion.<br/>
											But Wisdom says give it unfiltered,<br/>
											So that at my lowest others are lifted.<br/>
											So, this is the last judgement.<br/>
											A death sentence to future grudges.<br/>
											The new law under the present verdict.<br/>
											The best of me, regardless if you deserve it.<br/>
											</p>
